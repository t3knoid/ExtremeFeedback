# ExtremeFeedback
Experiments on extreme feedback devices

# Background
This project will be used to learn how to program extreme feedback devices. A simple of such a device is a lamp or LED connected to the computer that will provide some sort of status. Instructions on how to create hardware and software components will be provided.

# Simple Case - Control a USB Device Connected Device
This experiment will use a single LED connected to the computer using the USB interface. A C# application will be used to control the LED.

# Advance Case - Control a Network Connected Device
This experiment will use a device connected to a network and controlled from a remote computer.
